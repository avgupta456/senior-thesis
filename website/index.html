    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize message passing to operate directly
      on graph structured data, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance
      in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks.
      In order to build trust, promote transparency, and facilitate real-world
      applications, GNNs must be made explainable. But while models such as
      GNNExplainer and SubgraphX explain node and graph classification tasks,
      link explanation, particularly on heterogeneous graphs, remains
      underexplored. In this work, we propose a new explanation format for link
      prediction, where only a subset of immediate neighbors of the target edge
      are selected. We test four explanation methods on the Facebook, IMDB, and
      LastFM heterogeneous graph datasets. Each dataset has distinct properties
      that encourage a robust explanation model. We sample explanations of
      varying sparsity and measure the characterization score to assess a
      candidate explanation's necessity and sufficiency. We report
      characterization scores for 1-node, 5-node, and 10-node explanations. We
      make key changes to the GNNExplainer loss function and to the SubgraphX
      filtering method that yield significant improvements in explanation
      quality. Overall, we find our modified SubgraphX method outperforms
      existing baselines by 11% and our modified GNNExplainer outperforms
      existing baselines by 21% on average. The embedding baseline remains a
      fast and viable approach for small explanations on high degree graphs,
      while GNNExplainer produces the strongest explanations across all other
      configurations. Additionally, we make open-source contributions to the
      PyTorch Geometric library to allow for future extensions. Altogether, our
      work is the first exploration of heterogeneous link explanation and lays
      the foundation for future explanation approaches.
